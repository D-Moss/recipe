			<p>
				Garlic Butter Chicken Bites with Creamy Parmesan Pasta is a delightful dish that combines tender, flavoreful chicken with a rich, creamy pasta. The chicken breast, cut into bite-sized pieces, is seasoned with salt, pepper, and Italian seasons before being cooked to golden perfection in olive oil. Once cooked, the chicken is coated in a luscious garlic butter sauce made from unsalted butter and minced garlic, adding a savory depth to each bite. This dish is not only delicious but also visually appealing, with fresh parsley sprinkled on top for a burst of color and freshness.

			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<h3>Step 1: Cook the Pasta</h3>
			<ul>
				<ol>
					<span>Boil water:</span>
					<p>
						Begin by boiling a large pot of salted water.
					</p>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<span>Cook the pasta:</span>
					<p>
						Add 12 oz of your chosen pasta (fettuccine is recommended) to the boiling water. Cook according to the package instructions, typically 8-10 minutes, until the pasta reaches an al dente texture.
					</p>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<span>Drain and set aside:</span>
					<p>
						Once cooked, drain the pasta and set aside while you prepare the chicken and sauce.
					</p>
				</ol>
			</ul>

			<h3>Step 2: Cook the Chicken Bites</h3>
			<ul>
				<ol>
					<span>Heat the olive oil:</span>
					<p>
						In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat.
					</p>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<span>Prepare the chicken:</span>
					<p>
						Cut the boneless, skinless chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces.
					</p>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<span>Season the chicken:</span>
					<p>
						Sprinkle the chicken pieces with salt, pepper, and 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning.
					</p>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<span>Cook the chicken:</span>
					<p>
						Place the chicken pieces in the hot skillet and cook for about 6-8 minutes, turning occasionally until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through. Once cooked, remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
					</p>
				</ol>
			</ul>

			<h3>Step 3: Make the Garlic Butter Sauce</h3>
			<ul>
				<ol>
					<span>Melt the butter:</span>
					<p>
						In the same skillet used to cook the chicken, reduce the heat to medium and add 4 tablespoons of unsalted butter.
					</p>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<span>Saute the garlic:</span>
					<p>
						Once the butter has melted, add 4 cloves of minced garlic. Saute for about 30 seconds, stirring constantly to prevent burning.
					</p>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<span>Toss the chicken in the sauce:</span>
					<p>
						Return the cooked chicken bites to the skillet and toss them in the garlic butter sauce, ensuring that the chicken is fully coated with the rich flavors. Let the chicken sit in the sauce for another 1-2 minutes to absorb the garlic butter goodness.
					</p>
				</ol>
			</ul>

			<h3>Step 4: Prepare the Creamy Parmesan Sauce</h3>
			<ul>
				<ol>
					<span>Melt butter in a separate skillet:</span>
					<p>
						In a second skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.
					</p>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<span>Saute garlic:</span>
					<p>
						Add 2 more cloves of minced garlic and saute for about 30 seconds.
					</p>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<span>Add cream and broth:</span>
					<p>
						Stir in 1 cup of heavy cream and 1/2 cup of chicken broth. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, allowing it to thicken slightly.
					</p>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<span>Add Parmesan:</span>
					<p>
						Gradually whick in 1 cup of grated Parmesan cheese. Continue stirring until the sauce becomes smooth and creamy. If necessary, adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.
					</p>
				</ol>
			</ul>

			<h3>Step 5: Combine Pasta and Sauce</h3>
			<ul>
				<ol>
					<span>Toss pasta in the sauce:</span>
					<p>
						Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the creamy Parmesan sauce.
					</p>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<span>Adjust consistency:</span>
					<p>
						If the sauce is too thick, you can add a plash of reserved pasta water or more chicken broth to loosen it up.
					</p>
				</ol>
			</ul>

			<h3>Step 6: Serve</h3>
			<ul>
				<ol>
					<span>Plate the pasta:</span>
					<p>
						Divide the creamy Parmesan pasta onto serving plates.
					</p>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<span>Top with garlic butter chicken:</span>
					<p>
						Add the garlic butter chicken bites on top of each plate of pasta.
					</p>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<span>Optional garnish:</span>
					<p>
						Drizzle extra garlic butter sauce over the top if desired.
					</p>
				</ol>
				<ol>
					<span>Garnish with parsley</span>
					<p>
						Sprinkle freshly chopped parsley over the dish for a pop of color and flavor.
					</p>
				</ol>
			</ul>
